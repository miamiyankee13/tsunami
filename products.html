      <p>Manufacturing live resin extracts allows us to always capture the most
        accurate flavor and smell profile of the material being processed. The
        term live resin refers to the plant still living when it is extracted.
        While the material may not technically still be alive, as soon as it is
        harvested it is frozen and remains frozen throughout the extraction
        process. This allows us to preserve valuable traits of the material
        such as the amount of trichomes, terpene profile, and aroma. These
        traits all carry over into the final product, creating a high-potent
        flavorful extract.</p>

      <h2 class="center">Sauce</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Often referred to as HTFSE, or high terpene full spectrum extract, our
        sauce is the highest quality product we have to offer. Throughout the
        sauce making process, THCA crystals and terpenes naturally separate,
        forming two different products. These two products are mixed back
        together using a special ratio to form the perfect blend of crystals
        and terpenes.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
      <h2 class="center">Sugar</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Often referred to as HCFSE, or high cannabinoid full spectrum extract,
        our sugar is made using almost the same process for our sauce. A few
        tweaks here and there - boom, we have ourselves some sugar. This
        product has a higher crystal to terpene ratio than our sauce. If you
        find sauce to be too flavorful for your liking, then sugar should be
        right up your alley!</p>

      <h2 class="center">Badder</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Call us old school, but you can't go wrong with some good ol'
        fashioned badder. Badder is basically shatter taken to the next level.
        With a little heat and agitation we can turn a beautiful, glassy slab
        of shatter into a stable, terpy slab of badder. While it may not be as
        sexy as our sauce or sugar, it is definitley a wave worth catching.</p>

      <h2 class="center">HTE Vape Cartridges</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Due to our special ratios used during our sauce/sugar processes,
        we will sometimes end up with an excess amount of terpenes. These
        terpenes are then used to fill our vape cartridges. Vaping this oil
        tastes like you are dabbing right out of the cartridge!</p>
